Late Binding with a VBScript Client
Late-binding is so called because you don’t know if the methods exist until run-time. 
Late binding is based on the standard COM IDispatch interface, which has methods that 
return information about the methods and properties on an interface so that they can be 
discovered at run time. As an analogy, it’s somewhat the equivalent of using .NET 
reflection to find the structure and methods of .NET classes.
